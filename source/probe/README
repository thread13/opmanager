 1. it is extremely frequent for a modern Linux system to have /bin/bash installed, so these monitors are targetting bash instead of more classic Bourne Shell
 2. every script here shall declare one probe() function, which in turn shall output the probe result to stdout -- e.g. 0.26 for a 1-minute load average sample .
 3. under normal circumstances, the scripts shall not print anything else, and use the debug()/log()/warning()/error() functions to log various messages, which will go to the local syslog system.
 4. the scripts _may_ invoke that probe() routine at the end of the script for debugging purposes; this invocation will be replaced in production "monitor" sample code.
 5. likewise, the scripts _may_ invoke the "shell library" script as '. ../mylib/include.bash' or 'source ../mylib/include.bash' for testing purposes; 
    in the "monitor" script, this line will be replaced by the "library" script content.
 6. the scripts _shall_ define the following environment variables - what shall happen _after_ sourcing ../mylib/include.bash, if that is the case :
     - PROBENAME, which shall be the probe tag
     - PROBEVAR, which shall be the name of the probe
 7. the script /may/ define a message() function, which output will be added to the report header.
